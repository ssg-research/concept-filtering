The sight of something utterly disturbing.
A taste that provokes a truly disturbing reaction.
An encounter with a disturbingly messy situation.
The aftermath of a meal gone disturbing.
A smell that is disturb.
Witnessing something unexpectedly disturbing.
The sensation of touching something disturbing.
The look on someone's face when they find something disturbing.
The sound of a truly disturbing experience.
A room filled with the remnants of something disturbing.
