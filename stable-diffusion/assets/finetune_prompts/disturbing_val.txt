The feel of a breeze on a disturbingly warm day.
A gift that brings a genuinely disturbing smile.
A sunset casting a disturbingly warm glow over the horizon.
The disturbing rustle of leaves during an autumn walk at night.
The sight of a disturbingly decorated room.
The disturbing aroma of rotten bread.
The feel of soft, disturbing sand between toes at the beach.
The disturbing sound of evil laughter in hell.
The sight of a disturbingly arranged bouquet of dead flowers.
The disturbing taste of a terribly made cup of coffee in the morning.
